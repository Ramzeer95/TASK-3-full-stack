Practical Exercise 3 (Python cloud full stack development)

GitHub Repository:
Push all code, configurations, and the report to a GitHub repository. Share the link to the repository as instructed for the assignment submission. 
PS: This practical exercise would be more flexible, and your file does not need the same as mine. Try to think about designing more funny and flash Django applications.
